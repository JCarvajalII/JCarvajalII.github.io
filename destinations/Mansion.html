				<h1>The Mansion</h1>
				<p> The Mansion consists of an elegantly-designed Spanish Colonial Revival main building and a guest house. The elaborate main gate, made of ornate   ironwork, was earlier reported as a replica of one of the main gates at Buckingham Palace in London, which is false. The front gate is still one       of the most photographed section of the property. Tourists can visit the Mansion's museum containing presidential memorabilia. Across the road from the Mansion House is Wright Park, a quiet promenade with a long reflecting pool lined with pine trees. A long stairway leads visitors to the back where ponies for children are available for hire. Dotted all around the nearby hills are vacation homes and small inns.
