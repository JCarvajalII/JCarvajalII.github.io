				<h1>Tam-awan Village</h1>
				<p> The Tam-Awan Village have number of Igorot huts within the village which will allow you to see how the homes of the mountain people look like. You do get a chance to climb up the wooden ladder and see what is inside each hut.There are a few native handicraft items that are sold aside from some books and publications about the Igorot people, their culture and traditions. You can also order a hot cup of native coffee which gets to be a welcome treat after completing a tour of the entire village, especially on a cold and rainy day.
